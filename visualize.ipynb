Consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and thos electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to kennedy. In the same vein, &quot;faithless&quot; electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. Over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. Yet, the Electoral College still has its defenders. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. \n",
